                <h1>About Senakulo</h1>
                <p>
        Senakulo tradition in Sariaya, Quezon began in 2006 as a collaborative effort among the local tourism office, the Parish of Saint Francis, and dedicated educators who shared a vision of promoting faith and culture through art. Guided by the support of Mayor Durumal’s tourism office and Rev. Fr. Andrew Hernandez, the project was brought to life under the leadership of Sir Federico “Fidi” Ceribo, a teacher and director who introduced his theater group Sirka Kayumanggi as the first cast members. Alongside him were Maria Teresa “Tek” Cuello-Baligod and Sir Eric J. Dedace, who helped craft the first script and establish the foundation of the performance.

                <p>  From its humble beginnings, the Senakulo of Sariaya grew into a powerful form of street theater that goes beyond acting. It is a living expression of faith, sacrifice, and community devotion. Presented every Holy Wednesday, it serves not only as a reenactment of Christ’s Passion but also as a spiritual offering, a panata-sacred  vow that unites the people in creativity, service, and shared belief. Through the years, it has become a symbol of the town’s enduring faith, cultural pride, and collective spirit.
